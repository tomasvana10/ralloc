## Installation and self-hosting

If you are interested in self-hosting ralloc, follow these steps.

Requirements: `pnpm`, `git`

1. Clone the repository using `git clone https://github.com/tomasvana10/ralloc`
2. `cd ralloc`
3. `pnpm i`
4. Create however many OAuth applications you want (ralloc currently uses Google and GitHub).
5. Configure the provider's SVG endpoints in [constants.ts](https://github.com/tomasvana10/ralloc/blob/main/src/lib/constants.ts). If you intend to use the providers that ralloc uses, you can skip this step.
6. Create 3 environment files:

`.env.development`

```
# port should be 3001 if you are running with docker
NEXT_PUBLIC_URL=http://localhost:3000 
AUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

`.env.production`

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_URL=your-host-url
AUTH_URL=your-host-url
```

`.env.local`

```
AUTH_SECRET="secret auto-generated by next-auth"
AUTH_<provider>_ID=...
AUTH_<provider>_SECRET=...
```

### Running with docker

1. `docker network create ralloc_net`
2. `cd .docker`

**In development**: `docker compose -f compose.dev.yaml up --build` (`-d` to start detached).

**In production with CI/CD**:
1. `docker compose -f compose.prod-ci.yaml pull`
2. `docker compose -f compose.prod-ci.yaml up`

**In production without CI/CD**:
1. `docker compose -f compose.prod-local.yaml up --build`


### Running without docker

**In development**: `pnpm run dev`

**In production**:

1. Remove `output: "standalone"` from `next.config.ts`.
2. `pnpm run build && pnpm run start`

## Todo

- [ ] i18n through `next-intl` (probably - consider using crowdin for collab. aim to support japanese, czech, french and korean)
- [ ] Consider making a wiki
- [ ] Create `CONTRIBUTING.md`
- [ ] Create privacy and usage related markdown documents
- [ ] Create support/help page (on the website or on github)
- [ ] Implement group control - UI, websockets, etc.
- [ ] Add reverse mapping for the group a user is in (probably like `host:<hostId>:session:<code>:user:<userId>:<groupName>`)
- [ ] Consider Lua scripting to ensure atomicity when joining/leaving a group
- [ ] Consider sliding window rate limits with redis based on user id
- [ ] Consider adding alternative authentication methods (`GitHub`)
- [ ] Revise Redis DB structure for optimisations and removal of redundant keys
- [x] (_partial_) Document info for installation and usage on `README.md`
- [x] [Containerise](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/with-docker-compose) - include redis image
- [x] Configure Cloudflare tunnel and security
- [x] Buy domain `ralloc.xyz`
- [x] Implement home and session viewer
- [x] Implement REST API for sessions
- [x] Add basic Google authentication
